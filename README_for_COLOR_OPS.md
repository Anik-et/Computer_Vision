# Average Grayscale

A simple way to reduce an RGB image to grayscale is to calculate the average of its Red, Green, and Blue components, and use this average as the only component for its pixels. Let's see it working.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Anik-et/Computer_Vision.git
```


## Usage

To use the code, follow these steps:

1. Install the dependencies using the following command:

```
pip install numpy matplotlib opencv-python
```

2. Run the notebook using [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).

# Code Overview
The code demonstrates the following functionalities:

- Converting an image to grayscale using the average of RGB components.
- Implementing weighted grayscale using predefined values for each color channel.
- Converting grayscale images to binary images using various thresholds.
- Performing adaptive thresholding for images with varying lighting conditions.
- Removing color from an image and converting it to black and white.

# Contributing
- Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements or feature suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

# Acknowledgments
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) for providing the adaptive thresholding algorithms.
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for the visualization of the images and histograms.
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) for efficient array operations.
