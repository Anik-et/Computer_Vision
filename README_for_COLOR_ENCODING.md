# Image Representation and Manipulation

This repository contains examples and code snippets related to basic image representation and manipulation using Python. It covers various aspects such as image creation, color encoding, image file management, resolution, and image transformations. 

## Image Representation

Raster images are represented as matrices of pixels. The provided code demonstrates the creation of grayscale and RGB images as numpy arrays and their visualization using matplotlib.

## Color Encoding

Color can be encoded in different ways, such as RGB, RGBA, CMYK, or HSL. This repository focuses on RGB encoding, where each pixel is represented as a vector with three channels: Red, Green, and Blue. The code examples show how to play with different colors and their representation.

## Image File Management

The code showcases how to open and save image files using Python, highlighting the subtleties involved in managing different image file formats and data types.

## Resolution

Understanding the resolution of an image is essential in image processing. This repository provides examples of images with various resolutions, explaining their pixel densities and the computational implications.

## Rotations and Flips

Image rotations and flips are common operations in image processing. The code demonstrates how to perform these operations using NumPy, including rotating images at different angles and flipping them horizontally and vertically.

## Manipulate Some Pictures

This section provides examples of manipulating different images, such as flipping, rotating, and changing their data types.

Feel free to explore the provided code and experiment with the image manipulation techniques demonstrated.
